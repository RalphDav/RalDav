Hi, 
Ralph here. I have been into programming since the age of 9, where I was introduced to BASIC, which went on till the age of 15.
Post that at the age of 16 was introduced to C++, and then C, Java and DotNet.. I love languages - human and computers.
I speak 2 languages fluently, and 2 other languages on an elementary level :)
